              <p>Medical imaging has changed the face of modern healthcare sector by precisely imaging the human body and treating chronic diseases. According to EMC Digital Universe, hospitals are generating 50 Peta-bytes of data every year across the globe. A staggering 90% of all the healthcare data comes from medical imaging where more than 97% of it goes un-analyzed or un- used. Such heavy database generation, storage and accurate interpretation represents an enormous challenge for healthcare organizations. It is even more challenging for developing countries like India where every year 5.2 million deaths are reported due to incorrect or late diagnosis, improper team coordination, shortage of medical staff and devices in the hospital. Computerized medical imaging analysis is an essential current need to reduce error, costs,processing time and accelerate medical prognosis. </p> <br>
              <p>Recent progresses in deep learning have shed new light on medical image analysis by finding meaningful associations and patterns which are presently time – consuming or repetitive, and difficult to analyze by skilled healthcare professionals. Deep learning algorithm based machines try to interpret, classify and quantify imaging data in the form of complex patterns and structure by building multi – layer artificial neural networks. These neural networks consists of interconnected neurons grouped into three different types of layers namely input, hidden and output layer(s). The word ‘deep’ refers to multiple numbers of hidden layers (sometimes, more than 1000). Each neuron connection is associated with a random weight. They can be set according to the importance of input value. After receiving the raw data at input layer, complex mathematical associations and patterns are made and tested in the hidden layers. Such a network now learns these patterns and may predict new data and or identify similar data. It is very similar to the learning process that occurs in our brain’s neocortex. The power of deep learning algorithms is not limited to identification of unhealthy tissues, performing repetitive segmentation tasks, automation of imaging processes but also detection and prediction (years before) of chronic disorders like epilepsy, Alzheimer’s, different type of cancers, depression etc. According to Signify Research – a market intelligence and consultancy to the global healthcare technology industry, deep learning based healthcare solutions will become a $300 million industry by 2021. There are already a number of FDA approved life saving AI diagnostic devices such as IDx – DR for detecting retinopathy, QauntX for evaluating breast abnormalities, Aidoc for identifying intracranial hemorrhages in head CT scans and etc in the market.</p>

              <p>‘Show me your friends and I will tell you who you are’ is a forever status for those who try to judge or interpret a personality simply by asking questions about other people from them. Personalities can vary from person to person and in a person it-self.</p>
              <br>
              <p>According to the recent theories a person can have multiple qualities and based on their levels, they transform or collect into what is called a personality.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In this fast technologically passed world it has become very important to know and build a strong, smart and superficial virtual personality which not only attracts the visitor but also impacts your personality in his virtual world. Thus, safeguarding it is an important issue of today’s era.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Firstly what is a virtual personality?</p>
              <br>
              <p>It’s a giant term with various definitions. Let’s look at them one by one.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Many a times,” virtue” is interpreted as soul. A soul which is not there but its body which is assigned to that soul is physically alive. This depressed, sad, mentally absent personality is considered as a virtual personality.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Another meaning of this vast term is social networking ids. Your Whatsapp account, twitter, Face-book, yahoo, Orkut ids come under this category. The way you present your display pictures, status, about yourself and updates reveals your virtual personality.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Updating “feeling sad” interprets that you are sad and so on. Potentially, every virtual personality is a work of art, but actually; only those of them become a work of art, which have the radiance of form, which is perceived directly. Hence, in this socially active world one must know how to update status, what to and what not to on their respective walls.</p>
              <br>
              <p>In the old golden times our grandparents used to quote, ” By the way you dress and talk, you reflect your personality in the eyes of beholder”. This virtual self acts as a medium for you and another person to interact and understand each other.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Try to never be false or manipulative.</p>
              <br>
              <p>By safeguarding your accounts one should not feel to post nothing at all but post in a limit and the required data. A limit to everything looks satisfactory.</p>
              <br>
              <p>People often fall for not real (Not real) personalities and get hurt. Various studies have found that this happened due to one reason i.e. “Virtual personality” which is considered in *personality in personality* acts as a pathway in between a real self and a not real self revealing neither of them but something new with better qualities than the real self.</p>
              <br>
              <p>It has not only tried to destroy our lives but on the contrary lead to some betterment in life (Mostly destruction). It tells about how imaginative and creative you are. One of the sites like “Create your virtual buddy” may show your creation.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Another very common definition to this word is our ‘fantasies’. The most fascinating and charming world of all times is our very own made “fantasy“.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Virtue is (also) something not real.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Everyone dreams to be better than present. To be perfect and to gain excellence is anyone’s fantasy. Psychological disorder treatments pay huge attention on this fantasy world which reflects your virtual personality. It reveals a personality which is not yours but which you wish/admire to be.</p>
              <br>
              <p>One must not allow their “virtual” self to over-power their true self and keep fantasies till the doors of fantasy only. Old is gold is not just a saying but has a social importance in human life and activities.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Fantasizing about a virtual friend or relationship acts like a graveyard dug/prepared by your virtual personality so one should always act real, stay real. Copying or commenting false statements would only make you more hypothetical for people to understand.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Use it as a platform to learn and not false identities which only brings havoc in society. At last doing things in limit is the key to success here.</p>
              <br>
              <p>Stay in limit, stay true to your kind and live a happy life.</p>
